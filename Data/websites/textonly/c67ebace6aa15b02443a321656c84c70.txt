Iraq’s Hezbollah Al-Nujaba Movement, which forms part of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), have claimed that the US has been planning to “transfer” senior Daesh commanders and other terrorists from eastern Syria to neighbouring Iraq.
“Washington is insisting on the implementation of a plot to return the terrorists to Iraq by transferring a large number of ISIS [Daesh] commanders and militants from the eastern Euphrates and other parts of Syria,” the movement said in an online statement.
Referring to the US as “occupiers” they added: “We stress that the Islamic Resistance of Iraq is monitoring all your destructive plots to prevent the dangers which threaten the Iraqi provinces.”
