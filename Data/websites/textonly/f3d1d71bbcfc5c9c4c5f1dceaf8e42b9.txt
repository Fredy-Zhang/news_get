Founding Chairman of Quilliam Maajid Nawaz believes “China is preparing for war” as tensions between Beijing and the west increase due to a proposed investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

Last month Australia proposed an independent, global investigation into the origins and the initial handling of the novel coronavirus.

The Chinese ambassador warned that Australia could face an economic hit if it does not back down from a push into the Beijing's  handling of the coronavirus.

Ambassador Cheng Jingye said the push was “dangerous” and could dissuade Chinese citizens not to travel or trade with Australia.

Mr Nawaz said he became aware of the “incredible danger” the Chinese Communist Party poses to the world when he learned it interned two million Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps.

“We are already in a cold war with them," he said.

“The Chinese Communist Party is preparing for it (war) and they have a strategy for us in the West and we have no strategy for dealing with them.”
