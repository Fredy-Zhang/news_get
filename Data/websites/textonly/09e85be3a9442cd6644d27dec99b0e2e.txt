Taipei, May 2 (CNA) A rough-toothed dolphin, which has rarely been seen around Taiwan, remained under treatment in Keelung in northern Taiwan Saturday after being found stranded the previous day, a local government official said.
The 20-year-old, weak and undernourished dolphin is in a more stable condition than Friday afternoon, when it was found near Taoyuan by members of the public and sent to Keelung, according to Keelung City official Tsai Fu-ning (蔡馥嚀).
The 2-meter-long dolphin was found swimming in circles about 15 meters from the coast in Dayuan District and became stranded, according to Kuo Hsiang-hsia (郭祥廈) from the Taiwan Cetacean Society.
It was lethargic at the time but breathing normally, Kuo said. The society has recruited volunteers to take care of the dolphin over the weekend.
There were two marks on the dolphin, one probably the result of attack from a Cigar shark that had already healed and the other a tumor, Tsai said.
It is the second time the animal rescue station in Badouzi fishing port has treated a live dolphin, Tsai said.
The species, although ranked "least concerned" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, is rarely seen in Taiwan.
It has only ever previously been spotted near Green Island southeast of Taiwan, and the species usually appears in warm waters beyond the continental shelf, according to the National Parks of Taiwan Biodiversity Database.
