After the list of the members of the group came out, many of the boys involved messaged the girls about being ‘inactive in the group’, defending themselves. Some other boys, meanwhile, made a new group chat ‘Jai ka skirt skrt gang’ to discuss ways of getting out of the mess. Appallingly, some of the boys in that new group made threats about the people who put up Instagram stories against them and then even asked for a new group to be made on Snapchat—since Snapchat allows conversations to be deleted. 
“We’ve all been extremely anxious lately. We’re being sent threats from random fake accounts for speaking up,” said one of the women involved in exposing the group chat, to VICE. “We have been trying to figure out how to go about all of this. It’s been tough, but we are definitely glad that we got this out there. No matter how much hate we are receiving at the moment, I’m glad that we gave other women a chance to speak up. And the topics that have been suppressed for the longest time are now coming up.”
Most of the members of the group are from the elite schools of Delhi and have now deactivated their handles. However, one of the members has posted an apology statement to his Instagram stories. 
The boys have also, allegedly, been booked under Section 66E of IT Act for Cyberbullying. Swati Maliwal, the Chairperson of the Delhi Commission For Women (DCW), posted saying that the DCW has issued notice to Instagram and Delhi Police regarding the incident.
