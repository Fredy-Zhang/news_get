New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will join Australia's national cabinet meeting on Tuesday to discuss COVID-19, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced.
The national cabinet meeting takes in the Prime Minister and all state and territory premiers and chief ministers.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was invited to join Australia's national cabinet meeting by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Mr Morrison suggested last Thursday she phone in to the meeting, and following national cabinet's agreement on Friday, she was formally invited and has accepted.
They are expected to discuss a mooted "trans-Tasman bubble" that would allow Kiwis and Australians to freely travel between countries.
New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters has said he is very keen on the idea of the trans-Tasman bubble and Health Director General Ashley Bloomfield said on Monday he was in constant contact with his Australian counterparts.
Mr Morrison also had a discussion with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday night, with the two leaders discussing how each of their countries had dealt with the coronavirus and how they would ease restrictions and open up the economy.
They also discussed Australia's push for an independent review into the origins of the global pandemic.
