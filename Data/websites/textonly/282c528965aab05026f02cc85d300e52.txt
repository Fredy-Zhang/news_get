Territoryâs physical distancing advice aims to slow the spread of the coronavirus and pay homage to regionâs cultural history
As Canadaâs Yukon territory braces for the coronavirus, residents have been asked keep one caribouâs length apart from each another. (For those not familiar with the dimensions of the reindeer, thatâs roughly equivalent to two husky lengths or eight loaves of sourdough bread.)
The light-hearted advice is part of a viral public health awareness campaign that seeks to inform residents and pay homage to the regionâs cultural history.
The guidelines from Yukonâs department of health also advised residents that keeping the distance of four ravens â the official bird of the territory â will help prevent transmission of the virus.
The most recent ad, released at the end of April, advises residents to maintain a distance of one cord of wood â the standard measurement for chopped firewood. âA cord of wood is actually 2.4 meters/8 feet long, but extra space means extra-safe,â the poster says.
(Provincial authorities also caution that while a one caribou â 2m â is a safe distance in terms of social distancing and Covid-19 mitigation, Yukoners should keep more than 90m away from actual caribou.)
Because of its geographic isolation and low population density, the Yukon territory has only recorded 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but has put measures in place to limit travellers at its borders with British Columbia and Alaska, where tourists often arrive.
