Lego says it had nothing to do with a Chinese state media video animation attacking Trump's coronavirus response
Screenshot of an animation posted by China's Xinhua News Agency, which uses Lego bricks to attack the US, on April 30, 2020.
The Lego Group has denied any involvement in an animation video posted by Chinese state media that attacks the US response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The video, which uses Lego figures and animated voice-overs, accuses the US of ignoring the early warnings of the virus and jokes about the country's inconsistency in handling the virus.
Lego told Business Insider that it wasn't involved in making the animation "in any way." Xinhua News Agency, which posted the video, did not respond to Business Insider.
In the animation — designed as a debate between the two toy figures — China accuses the US of ignoring the early warning signs of the virus in December 2019 and dismissing it as being "just a flu."
Toward the end of the video, the Statue of Liberty says: "We are always correct even though we contradict ourselves," to which the masked Lego figure replies: "That's what I love best about Americans... your consistency."
A company spokesperson told Business Insider: "We weren't involved in making the animation in any way. As a toy company, we're focusing on bringing play to children and families."
Trump has flip-flopped on his attitude to China over the course of the pandemic, having in January praised the country and president Xi Jinping's response.
