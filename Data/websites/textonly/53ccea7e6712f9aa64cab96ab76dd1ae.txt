Former Pope Benedict XVI links gay weddings to ‘the Antichrist’ in scathing new attack on LGBT+ rights
He rages: “100 years ago, everybody would have considered it to be absurd to speak of a homosexual marriage. Today, one is being excommunicated by society if one opposes it.”
Also condemning “the creation of human beings in the laboratory”, Pope Benedict added: “Modern society is in the middle of formulating an anti-Christian creed, and if one opposes it, one is being punished by society with excommunication.
“The fear of this spiritual power of the Antichrist is then only more than natural, and it really needs the help of prayers on the part of an entire diocese and of the Universal Church in order to resist it.”
The biography charts the life of the German ex-Pope, born Joseph Ratzinger, chronicling his rise within the Church from his early years in the Hitler Youth – an experience which clearly did not teach him any lasting lessons about the treatment of minorities.
He insisted: “There is also a need to acknowledge and promote the natural structure of marriage as the union of a man and a woman in the face of attempts to make it juridically equivalent to radically different types of union.
“Such attempts actually harm and help to destabilise marriage, obscuring its specific nature and its indispensable role in society.”
Although Popes usually serve until death, Benedict resigned in 2013 amid whispers of ill health, as well as brewing corruption and sex abuse scandals within the Church.
