Amid reports intimating that the White House is conditioning its support for Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank on negotiations over a Palestinian state, the administration stressed Friday that it continues to back Israelâs annexation plans, as long as they’re carried out in the framework of the peace plan President Donald Trump presented on January 28.

In exchange for American recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the areas the administration’s âPeace to Prosperityâ vision earmarks as part of Israel, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to freeze all settlement activity for the next four years in areas the plan envisions for a future Palestinian state, âand negotiate with the Palestinians in good faith on the basis of the Vision,â the spokesperson added.
							
âThis will give the Palestinians an opportunity to come to the table and negotiate a peace agreement that will result in the establishment of a state of their own. The United States stands ready and willing to offer wide-ranging assistance to facilitate a final peace agreement.â

The story itself does not make that claim. Rather, it quotes US officials saying that any Israeli annexations must come “in the context of an offer to the Palestinians to achieve statehood based upon specific terms, conditions, territorial dimensions and generous economic support.â

Indeed, the administrationâs position has not changed, a senior US official told The Times of Israel on Friday.

The US will recognize an Israeli application of sovereignty over parts of the West Bank when a) the joint US-Israel mapping committee has completed its work, b) the Israeli government implements the four-freeze of the areas earmarked for a future Palestinian state and c) the government formally agrees to negotiate with the Palestinians a final-status peace deal based on terms Trumpâs peace deal, the official said.
If the Palestinians continue to refuse to engage with the US and Israel on the plan, annexation can go ahead in the absence of a Palestinian state, he added.
Netanyahu has declared repeatedly that he considers the so-called deal of the century a golden opportunity that Israel must not miss, and that he is willing to fulfill the above-mentioned criteria before pressing ahead with annexation.

According to the wording of the âemergency governmentâ deal between Netanyahuâs Likud party and Benny Gantzâs Blue and White faction, starting July 1, 2020, Netanyahu âwill be able to bring the agreement reached with the US on the application of sovereignty [in the West Bank] for the approval of the cabinet and or the Knesset.â
In addition, âthe law will be passed as quickly as possibleâ¦ and will not be disrupted or delayed by the chairmen of either the House or the Foreign Affairs and Defense committees.â
The Netanyahu-Gantz deal stipulates that any Israeli action would need US backing, and must take into account Israelâs peace treaties with neighboring Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab states that have formal peace treaties and diplomatic relations with Israel.
While the Trump deal formally calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty in four years, it is conditioned on a long list of demands and requirement that no Palestinian leadership is likely to accept.
Still, some members of Netanyahuâs Likud party, as well as his current and potentially future coalition partners from the pro-settlement Yamina list, are staunchly opposed to the very notion of a Palestinian state on any parts of the West Bank. The US administrationâs insistence on making green light for annexation contingent on a (even theoretical) commitment to Palestinian statehood could hence complicate coalition negotiations.
