“The SAR Government strongly disagreed with the grossly irresponsible remarks and expressed deep regret about them,” it said.
In response, authorities claimed the law did not apply to those offices, sparking furious condemnation from defenders of Hong Kong’s democracy, as well as from several foreign governments including the US, UK, Australia, and European parliament.
In its Friday statement the government maintained the HKMAO and liaison office had “the power and responsibility over the proper and full implementation” of the Basic Law, and it was “clearly legitimate” for them to express concerns about the conduct of Hong Kong legislators.
“Any suggestion that those legitimate remarks by the HKMAO and the [liaison office] amount to interference only illustrates an ignorance of the constitutional order of the HKSAR and its relationship with the Central Authorities.”
“The SAR Government said it always respects and protects human rights and freedoms,” it said. “However, these rights are not absolute.”
“We therefore note with abhorrence certain overseas politicians’ request that the HKSAR Government should drop the charges against the arrested individuals. If we were to accede or to be seen to yield to such unreasonable demands, we would not only be unfair and unprofessional but would also act in violation of the spirit of the rule of law – a core value in Hong Kong,”
“The allegation by some that those arrests amounted to an attack on Hong Kong’s freedoms and a breach of the [Basic Law] is absurd and can hardly stand the test of any law-abiding jurisdiction.”
