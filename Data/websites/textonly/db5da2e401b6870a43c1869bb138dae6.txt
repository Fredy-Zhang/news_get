Egyptian film director and photographer Shady Habash died in Tora prison in the capital Cairo on Friday, according to human rights organisations. 
Habash, 24, had been in prison since March 2018 over directing a song mocking Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. 
Middle East Eye has not been able to verify independently the reason behind Habash's death, but a number of reports suggested that his death was avoidable. 
"Balaha" is a derogatory nickname for Sisi, in reference to a character from a classic Egyptian movie known for being a compulsive liar.
A statement by Essam after Habash's arrest said that the director "doesn’t have anything to do with the content and message of the song".
Charges brought against Habash and Gamal include membership of a "terrorist group," spreading false news, abuse of social media networks, blasphemy, contempt of religion and insulting the military.
Human Rights Watch has estimated that more than 60,000 political prisoners have been languishing in Egyptian jails since Sisi became president in 2014. 
The former army general has routinely jailed critics, including secular and Muslim Brotherhood politicians, journalists, and human rights defenders. Hundreds have died in custody through medical negligence or other poor detention conditions.
