President Jair Bolsonaro once again personally attended a protest in Brasilia and criticized the Supreme Court and Congress. This time, former minister Sergio Moro was also the target of the protest.

At the end, the president said: "I ask God that we have no problems this week, we have reached the limit, there is no more conversation, from now on, we will demand and enforce the Constitution. It will be enforced at any price, and it has a double hand".
