Far-right leader shakes hands with demonstrators as countryâs death toll exceeds 6,750. This blog is now closed.
Weâve launched a new global liveblog at the link below â follow me there for rolling coverage of the pandemic: 
The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) UK-wide survey of more than 22,000 health and care workers was conducted over the weekend before the governmentâs announcement of testing expansion.
At that time, 76% of all those surveyed said they had not been offered a test. Of those, 44% said they did not know how to access testing.
The RCN also found more than four in five temporary staff had not been offered Covid-19 testing, compared to three-quarters of permanent staff.
The survey found 79% of those working outside of the NHS had not been offered a test, compared with 75% in the health service.
It found that in care homes and prisons, about 50% did not know how to access tests. With temporary staff, this figure was 60%.
The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed on Sunday there is âenormous evidenceâ the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory â but did not provide any of the alleged evidence.
On Sunday, Pompeo said: âThere is enormous evidence that thatâs where this began,â later adding: âI can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.â
At one point, the secretary of state appeared confused over whether he was claiming the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes the Covid-19 disease) was deliberately engineered or escaped as the result of a lab accident.
âLook, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,â he said.
But when he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite â that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified â Pompeo replied: âThatâs right. I agree with that.â
The UK governmentâs plan to exit lockdown through a tracking app will need detailed justification to satisfy human rights and data protection laws, a report has warned.
Poor migrant workers across the country lost their jobs during the worldâs biggest pandemic lockdown, which began in late March to guard against the spread of new coronavirus.
Saturdayâs clash in western Indiaâs Gujarat is the latest in a spate of such protests across India.
The lifting of the state of emergency - involving closure of borders and airports, a daily curfew, and weekend lockdowns since mid-March - should be ratified by the government-controlled parliament on Wednesday, Vucic said.
The nation has now registered 101,147 confirmed cases of the virus and 7,025 deaths. The number of cases increased roughly 5% on Sunday from the previous day, while deaths rose by roughly 4%, the ministry said.
The new quarantine rules will apply to travellers, whether French or foreigners, as part of the fight against the new coronavirus.
France, which has been the fifth-hardest hit country with 24,895 deaths from Covid-19, is preparing to gradually lift lockdown measures from May 11. 
The union said in a statement on Facebook that it was âtruly elatedâ with the courtâs ruling on Friday. âNow the lives and livelihoods of mineworkers can be protected,â South Africaâs Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) president Joseph Mathunjwa said.
But AMCU filed the court action to demand national safety standards for mines, including sanitisation procedures and minimum level of protective gear, before they go back to work.The miners fear being infected because social distancing is near impossible inside deep mine shafts.
Portugal has downgraded its state of emergency to a category of âcalamityâ, as the rate of new coronavirus infections reached its lowest since the beginning of the outbreak, six weeks after a state of emergency was declared.
âItâs like being freed from prison,â enthused Rodrigo Garcia, 40, on a walk to Lisbonâs River Tagus with his wife, two sons and dog. âWeâve gone out here and there, but with the end of the state of emergency we feel much freer.â
A three-phase reopening plan begins on Monday, after a six-week state of emergency when people were urged to stay indoors except for brief exercise, and most non-essential services were shut. 
Beaches remain closed other than for water sports and exercise, but under the lesser state of calamity spending time in parks is no longer strictly forbidden. Still, police officers were out in force on Sunday urging people not to linger and to maintain social distancing.
âA state of calamity still means you should stay home as much as you can,â officer Sofia Gordinho told Reuters. âIf people want to sit in the sun for a bit, thatâs okay, but we are asking them to move on so others can come without it getting crowded.â
Magufuli, whose government has already drawn criticism for being secretive about the coronavirus outbreak and has previously asked Tanzanians to pray the coronavirus away, said the kits had âtechnical errorsâ.
The Covid-19 testing kits had been imported from abroad, Magufuli said during an event in Chato in the north west of Tanzania, although he did not give further details.
These samples were then submitted to Tanzaniaâs laboratory to test for the coronavirus, with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins.
âOn medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, Iâve had a test for Covid-19 and so wonât be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow,â he tweeted.
Latest figures show 2,033 people in London hospitals compared to 2,191 in the north-west, where the peak for hospitalisation appears to have been on 13 April, compared to 8 April in the capital.
Minister for Digital Affairs Cedric O, a member of President Emmanuel Macronâs inner circle, presented the app as a key element of Franceâs strategy to stave off the coronavirus as authorities grapple with the prospect of mass testing.
âThereâs nothing magical about this app, but itâs not technological coquetry either,â O wrote on online publishing platform Medium. âItâs only useful if itâs integrated into a global health system.â
Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk of one person infecting another, helping to isolate those who could spread the disease.
