More than 1,700 premature deaths have been avoided in the UK in the past month because of better air quality, according to a pan-European study.
The UK has avoided an estimated 1,752 deaths related to air pollution, second only to Germany at 2,083.

The figures come from a report by the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).
It said UK nitrogen dioxide levels had fallen 36%, with a 9% fall in particulate matter pollution (an airborne mix of materials such as dust, dirt and smoke).
Nitrogen dioxide is a gas emitted when fossil fuels are burnt at high temperatures, most commonly at power plants and in vehicles.

The CREA study also said 6,000 new cases of child asthma had been avoided, with 1,900 fewer A&E visits due to asthma, 1.3 million fewer days off work and 600 fewer premature births.
The countries with the biggest percentage falls in NO2 were Portugal (58%), Spain (51%) and Croatia (47%).
Authors of the research, Lauri Myllyvirta and Hubert Thieriot, said they used detailed statistical modelling to separate the effects of weather conditions (which can also affect air pollution) and changes in emissions.
In the UK, there have been more than 26,000 deaths linked to coronavirus and upwards of 227,000 worldwide.
The researchers said its "side effects should not be celebrated" but that it showed how quickly pollution can improve.
They said it was a "striking demonstration of the benefit to public health and quality of life if European decision-makers prioritise clean air, clean energy and clean transport in their plans to recover from the crisis".
