NI (2020-04-06) Iberdrola inicia la puesta en marcha en España de la mayor fotovoltaica de Europa_en  [pdf]
The construction, which took one year, employed 1,200 workers at peak times - 70% of them from Extremadura
The project added to the value chain with purchases worth 227 million euros from some thirty suppliers, many of them local
The plant will generate clean energy to supply 250,000 people per year, and will prevent the emission of 215,000 tonnes of CO2 every year
Iberdrola's clean energy investment plan includes installing 3,000 MW of wind and photovoltaic energy by 2022
The largest photovoltaic plant in Europe has just come into operation, and today, at 12 noon, it discharged its first MWh of clean energy into the electricity grid. Iberdrola has succeeded in commissioning the Núñez de Balboa project - the biggest photovoltaic plant in Europe - in record time. It was built in just one year and completed last December.
Núñez de Balboa, with 500 megawatts (MW) of installed power and involving an investment approaching €300m, is between the towns of Usagre, Hinojosa del Valle and Bienvenida in Badajoz. The plant, which is being developed in collaboration with Ecoenergías del Guadiana, is a record-breaking renewable flagship project:
Iberdrola is focusing its renewable strategy in Spain in Extremadura, where it plans to install more than 2,000 MW of photovoltaic generation by 2022.
Following the commissioning of Núñez de Balboa (500 MW), the company has more than 1,300 MW in six renewable photovoltaic projects in the pipeline: Francisco Pizarro (590 MW)in Torrecillas de la Tiesa, Ceclavín (328 MW) in Alcántara, Arenales (150 MW) in Cáceres, Campo Arañuelo I, II and III (150 MW), in the district of Almaraz, and Majada Alata and San Antonio (50 MW each), in Cedillo. It also has 300 MW with grid access available to plan another photovoltaic project. 
Iberdrola's plan to invest in renewable energies in Spain includes installing 3,000 new MW by 2022. By 2030, company expects to have installed 10,000 new MW. These projects will create jobs for 20,000 people.
Iberdrola leads Spain in renewable energies, with an installed wind power capacity of 6,000 MW and over 16,000 MW in renewable energy; an figure of around 32,000 MW worldwide. Its generation facilities are among the cleanest in the energy sector.
Iberdrola's commitment to a decarbonised economic model has led it to earmark 10 billion euros a year for investment in renewable energies, smart electricity distribution networks and storage technologies, on top of the 100 billion already invested since 2001. Of these, 25 billion have been invested in Spain.
Iberdrola is leading the transition towards a sustainable energy model through its investments in renewable energy, smart grids, large-scale energy storage and digital transformation, to offer the most advanced products and services to its customers. Thanks to its commitment to clean energy, Iberdrola is one of the companies with the lowest emissions and an international benchmark for its contribution to sustainability and the fight against climate change.
