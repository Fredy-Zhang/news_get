'First Muslims, Now Us': Akal Takht Chief Smells a Plot to Malign Sikhs as Some Nanded Pilgrims Test Positive
At least 115 of the over 3,000 pilgrims who have returned from the Hazur Sahib shrine in Maharashtra in recent days have tested positive for coronavirus, according to state government figures.
The jathedar who heads the supreme temporal seat of the Sikhs has now compared this to the maligning of the Muslim community after people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi were found carrying the virus on returning to their homes across the country.
He claimed there was a race to malign the entire Muslim community over the Tablighi Jamaat episode and the same kind of propaganda is being carried out now.
