A leading scientist says that prospects appear good but that concerns over safety could be the next hurdle for the vaccine's development.

Sir John Bell, the Regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, where one of the leading efforts to develop a vaccine is underway, said that the prospects for Oxford's candidate are "pretty good" and that "as every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up."
The researchers hope to have enough data from their phase-two trials that "we would get evidence that the vaccine has efficacy by the beginning of June."
Bell didn't offer a timeline for when a vaccine might be fully developed, but he said that in the rush for one, it is imperative to make sure that safety remains a top priority. He said the Oxford group has already conducted preclinical primate studies and taken other steps to make sure "we're being very careful."
"It's a big issue for us, is trying to be sure that we do this quickly but we don't miss out any of the key safety steps," he said.
"I think we've got reason to believe that the efficacy, the efficacy of the vaccine in terms of generating strong antibody responses, is probably going to be OK. The real question is whether the safety profile's going to be fine. So that's actually the main focus of the clinical studies," he said.
With so many trials and vaccine working groups across the globe, Bell said, the Oxford group wants to be sure that there can be "wide access" to its vaccine if it ultimately proves successful.
"One of our ambitions is to make sure that there's wide access around the globe should the vaccine be successful," he said, adding that the team wants to make sure developing countries aren't "left behind in the manufacturing race to get more vaccine available."
