A LEADING Russian medical activist and Putin critic has vowed to continue to "tell the truth" about the coronavirus crisis in Russia, despite increasing attempts to silence her by the Kremlin.
“Because what they are doing now, not telling doctors – they are trying to conceal cases of coronavirus pneumonia in the hospitals and that will lead to the mass infection and death of people.
Russia has seen an explosion of COVID-19 infections, with more than 106,000 people testing positive for the disease.
“They are really writing down other diagnoses, cardiovascular, a lot of other diseases that a person has. So that is why these statistics are not true.
Doctors from the Moscow Scientific and Practical Centre for Narcology said they were being forced to work without any protective clothing and only had access to one respiratory device.
“It is clear that it is the coronavirus. They haven’t given us any protective clothing. They said: ‘Until it is confirmed, work as normal’. We have access to one breathing device over a 24 hour period.
“Among staff, more than ten have temperatures. We also have staff with confirmed cases of pneumonia.”
He said: “The peak is not behind us, we are about to face a new and gruelling phase of the pandemic… the deadly threat of the virus remains.”
