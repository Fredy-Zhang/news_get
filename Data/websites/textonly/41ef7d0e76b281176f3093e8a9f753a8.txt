The Ugandan government has launched an investigation into the activities of a megachurch in Kampala after seven members of its internationally renowned children’s choir were diagnosed with Covid-19 following an overseas tour.
The church now has six choirs, each made up of children and adults. The choirs travel and perform all over the world, often for six months at a time. Members have performed in front of US President George W Bush at the White House and before the Queen at Buckingham Palace.
The minister said management “should have cut down the singing sessions because many activities were being cancelled worldwide”.
“Children are not supposed to be so much into fundraising activities. They fall short of education, they fall short of their time to play,” she said.
“I thank them [the church] for the work they’re doing for the country,” said the minister. “But I have noted that there are anomalies and I demand an answer.”
