Following a threat by a coalition of Nigerian lawyers to sue China for $200b over alleged adverse effects of Coronavirus outbreak on the country and its citizens, the Press Secretary to the Embassy of China in Nigeria, Mr. Sun Saixiong has called on them to desist from attacking and discrediting other countries. 
According to him, China is standing together with Nigeria and the international community in the global fight against COVID-19, a major public health crisis and other infectious diseases. 
Saixiong in a statement said: “Attacking and discrediting other countries will not save the time and lives lost. At this critical moment, we urge that Nigerian legal practitioners should do more things to enhance mutual trust, and help epidemic prevention and control in both countries, rather than dancing to the tune of a certain country to hype up the situation.”
Saixiong, who described the virus as a common enemy to all mankind, which may strike at any time and anywhere, said that China, like other countries, is also a victim and not a perpetrator, even less an accomplice of the COVID-19. 
He held that since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has, in an open transparent and responsible spirit, taken the most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough measures to contain its spread, and conduct international cooperation. China, he further maintained, has in this process, made tremendous sacrifices, accumulated valuable experience, and made significant contributions to the global response to which the international community bears witness and applauds.
