In Al-Jazeera interview, Mohsen Rezaei of nation’s Expediency Council reiterates conspiracy theory that coronavirus may have been created by US to target Islamic Republic
A top Iranian official has repeated his threat to “raze Israeli cities to the ground” if the Jewish state takes any action against the Islamic Republic, hinting that Tehran could attack even in retaliation to US military action, in the tense aftermath of the killing earlier this year of Iran’s top general Qassem Soleimani.

Rezaei said that in the immediate aftermath of Soleimani’s killing in a January 3 airstrike in Iraq, “Tel Aviv was not the issue at hand — we had to deal with America.”
							
But if the US makes “another mistake,” Iran could “carry out the other parts of our retaliation,” he said, an apparent reference to targeting Israeli cities.

Rezaei, also a former leader of Iranâs Revolutionary Guards, is considered a top adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Senior Iranian Official Mohsen Rezaee threatens to Raze Israeli Cities to the Ground, Adds: Our Show of Force Was More Important Than the Actual Retaliation for Soleimaniâs Killing; COVID-19 Is Man-Made
Senior Iranian Official Mohsen Rezaee threatens to Raze Israeli Cities to the Ground, Adds: Our Show of Force Was More Important Than the Actual Retaliation for Soleimaniâs Killing; COVID-19 Is Man-MadeMohsen Rezaee, the Secretary of Iranâs Expediency Council, said in an April 28, 2020 interview on Al-Jazeera Network (Qatar) that Iran would raze Israelâs cities to the ground if Israel takes âthe slightest initiativeâ against Iran. He added that Iranâs attack on the Ayn Al-Asad Air Base after the U.S. killing of Qasem Soleimani had been a harsh retaliation that caused many casualties and destroyed American aircrafts. Rezaee then said that Iranâs capabilities and military prowess are âmore important than the attack itself.â With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rezaee said that the virus is âsmartâ and man-made, and that the possibility that it was an anti-Iranian bio-weapon has not been refuted so far.See more: https://www.memri.org/tv/iran-mohsen-rezaee-expediency-retaliation-soleimani-devastating-coronavirus-western-bioweapon

He repeated Iranian claims that a subsequent attack on the Ayn al-Assad Air Base in Iraq housing US troops and equipment had injured 60 people and destroyed planes and choppers.

âIranâs revenge against America for the assassination of Soleimani will be severeâ¦ Haifa and Israeli military centers will be included in the retaliation,â he said in January.
âWeâre standing steadfast against those who seek our lives. Weâre standing with determination and with force. Whoever tries to attack us will receive a crushing blow in return,â Netanyahu declared in a January conference in Jerusalem.
“So far, this possibility has not been refuted,” he said when asked about his previous remarks on the matter.
“The virus is smart and unnatural,” he added. “It is man-made. It is different from natural viruses like SARS and others. Therefore, there are still suspicions out there.”
