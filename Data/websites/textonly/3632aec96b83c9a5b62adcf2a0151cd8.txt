If You're Complaining About COVID-19 Misinformation Online AND About Section 230, You're Doing It Wrong

The government's new power to decide what is or isn't "real" news allowed it to consolidate its power over the local press. One newspaper was sold to a Malaysian firm that also performed PR work for the Prime Minister, giving the PM the ability to produce news unlikely to ever be classified as "fake."


Part of this effort is apparently meant to deter citizens from reporting accurately about the spread of infection. Cambodia reported 122 positive cases but also claims there have been no new positive COVID-19 tests in the past 16 days. It appears the government wants its citizens -- and perhaps the rest of the world -- to believe the threat has passed, or is, at least, firmly under control. Many of those arrested were accused of posting "fake news" about COVID-19 to social media.


Even directly quoting the Prime Minister appears to be a crime under this law, as well as the new powers the government handed to itself by declaring a state of emergency.

On April 7, Phnom Penh police arrested an online journalist, Sovann Rithy, for allegedly “stirring chaos by quoting from a Hun Sen speech: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt [because of the pandemic], sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.” The authorities charged Rithy with “incitement to commit a felony” and ordered his detention at Phnom Penh’s Police Judiciare detention facility. The Information Ministry revoked the license for his online broadcasting site, TVFB, on grounds that Rithy had broadcast information “to generate an adverse effect on the security, public order and safety of society.”

 I would call it funny how authoritarian governments around the world are so afraid of free speech, if it wasn't so horrifying. I don't have the same compunction for power that they seem to have, so I don't understand it. I recognize it, but I don't understand it.
These psychopaths don't seem to realize that their populations will only stand for this for so long before they do something about it. Yes those in power tend to have the military and police on their  side, but at some point, the non psychopaths in those ranks might come to understand how the policies exhibited impact their friends and families. The question then will be how to go about replacing governments with non-psychopaths, something even we haven't figured out yet.
Yes there a a couple of totalitarian regimes that have managed to exist for quite a while now, but things change, and the rate of change is ever increasing. It is only a matter of time, how much time is unknown.
Jailing and/or killing those that speak truth to power only creates martyrs for the cause, something those in power actually don't want. How they will react when they come to this realization will be interesting to watch, but I doubt I will still be around when it happens (too old and there is no current expectation for this to happen quickly).
 With 'fake news' defined pretty much from the outset as 'speech that those in power don't like' while it's disgusting to see it used like this it is sadly not in any way surprising. 
Without Clarification from above, what do we have below? We get to Guess and comment and make opinions. And those above Come down and Beat us in the head for Their incompetence.
 The "fake news" wasn't coined by the US. The gov of Cambodia appears to be correct that large parts of the coverage of it are misleading enough to be fake even if it's all mostly true at some level.
