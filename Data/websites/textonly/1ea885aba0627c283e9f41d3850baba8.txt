The World Health Organization has remained firm on its stand that there are no proof of any definite cure yet.
As the world reels under the new novel coronavirus crisis, countries in Africa are already importing a 'cure.'

The countries of Tanzania, Congo-Brazzaville, and Guinea-Bissau in Africa are importing a herbal tonic from Madagascar which is being dubbed as the cure to coronavirus, even though the World Health Organization has remained firm on its stand that there are no proof of any definite cure yet.

“The Covid-Organics will be distributed free of charge to our most vulnerable compatriots and sold at very low prices to others. All profits will be donated to IMRA to finance scientific research,” the president  of Madagascar, Andry Rajoelina, wrote on Twitter.

The US based National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has also warned against 'remedies' for coronavirus, including herbal therapies and teas, maintaning that the best way to avoid the virus was to avoid exposure.
