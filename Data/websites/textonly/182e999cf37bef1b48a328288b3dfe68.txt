LONDON (Reuters) - Britainâ€™s COVID-19 death toll has risen by 288 to 28,734, according to figures announced on Monday by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. 
The increase was the smallest since late March, Hancock said, adding that he expected it to rise in coming days as the numbers tended to be lower during the weekend.
