Israel's Supreme Court convened Sunday to decide whether Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu should be barred from leading a unity government as he faces corruption charges.
Israel's top court is deciding whether corruption charges should bar Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming a government. 
A ruling against Netanyahu would be a serious blow to Israeli governance. Three elections — the most recent in March — have failed to conclusively decide the country's leadership. 
The deal had been supported by Israel's parliament. But opposition parties and watchdogs petitioned Israel's supreme court to block Netanyahu's leadership as he faced a series of corruption charges.
Israeli law doesn't force a sitting prime minister to step down if indicted, though Netanyahu is the first Israeli leader to be indicted while in office.
