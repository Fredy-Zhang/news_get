The first fin whale of the 2013 whaling season is brought in to Hvalfjord, Iceland, just outside of Reykjavik. The country's two whaling companies will not hunt this year, and possibly ever again.
Citing the pandemic, whale watching, and a lack of exports, one of the three largest whaling countries may be calling it quits.
As public opinion changes and consumption of whale meat declines, commercial whaling may be one step closer to a permanent end in Iceland and possibly the world. For the second year in a row, Iceland, one of three remaining whaling nations, will not hunt any whales.
One reason, Loftsson said, was the social distancing restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which would make crewing vessels and processing whales impractical. But Hvalurâs ships also stayed in port in 2019, and Loftsonn acknowledged that there were bigger issues at play. For one, his company hunts fin whales primarily for export to Japan, which has become a difficult market.
This change in attitude is seemingly a consequence of a dramatic shift in Iceland: Support for hunting whales has declined as the income derived from watching them has climbed.
In the northern coastal village of Hauganes (population: 137), the number of whale watching visitors rose from 4,000 in 2015 to 17,000 by 2018.
Whale watching trips that depart from the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik operate in the eastern part of a large body of water called Faxaflói Bay, which in recent years is also where minke whaling has taken place. In 2007, a small portion of the bay was set aside as a sanctuary to prevent whale watchers and whalers from descending on the same whales.
That loss of access also has coincided with a precipitous decline in domestic consumption of a food that, Finnsson says, wasnât exactly looked at lovingly even during its heyday.
âWhen I was a kid in Akureyri in the north, minke whale meat was our âWednesday meat,â â he recalls with a smile. âIt was very cheap, and it was not the sort of thing a family would offer on Sundays. It was nothing good.â
By 2018, a Gallup poll conducted for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) found that only one percent of Icelanders ate whale meat regularly, while 84 percent claimed never to have eaten it at all.
The lack of enthusiasm for whale meat in Iceland is mirrored in Norway, where the number of whaling vessels dropped by almost half from 2016 to 2017. Among them, these remaining ships kill, process, and sell barely a third of the countryâs official quota.
Icelandâs experience suggests that internal indifference and the rise of whale watching over whale killing could finally push global commercial whaling over the precipice.
âThe last remaining whalers seem to be making an exit,â says Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation for IFAW. âHunting whales with cameras delivers economic benefits to coastal communities around the world, and Iceland is pointing the way.â
