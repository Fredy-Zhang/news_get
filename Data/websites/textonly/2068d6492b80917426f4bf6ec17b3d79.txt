Iraqi security forces are engaged in a new military operation against sleeper cells belonging to the Islamic State militant group, authorities announced on Monday.
Meanwhile, analysts claim the militant organisation is taking advantage of the coronavirus lockdown, coalition troop withdrawals and political stagnation in Baghdad to ramp up its activities, following a spate of deadly attacks in recent weeks.
Last week, the group claimed a suicide attack that wounded four outside an intelligence headquarters in the northern province of Kirkuk.
"Combat operations have reached a level we haven't seen in a while," said Iraqi security expert Hisham Al-Hashemi.
The militants could also be exploiting the political deadlock in Baghdad, where top leaders are focused on tense talks over a new government, the consequences of a collapse in global oil prices, and budget disputes with autonomous Kurdish authorities.  
Even more advantageous for the Islamic State group is the significant troop drawdown by the 7,500-strong US-led coalition, which led the offensives to counter the militants after they overran swaths of the country in 2014.
