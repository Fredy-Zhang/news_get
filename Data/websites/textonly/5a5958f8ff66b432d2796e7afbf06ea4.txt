There are no new cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand, Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield confirmed on Monday.
One probable case was reclassified as confirmed, although that does not affect the overall number of confirmed and probable cases. The total remains at 1487, with 1137 confirmed cases - the number that is reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Seven people are hospitalised nationwide, with none in the ICU. Sixteen significant clusters remain, although three are categorised as closed due to no new cases for two incubation cycles. 
Dr Bloomfield said the country will remain under alert level 3 for the duration of the preliminary two-week period to ensure there is no undetected community transmission.
"It's not just about the number of cases or the pattern, but people taking the expectations around physical distancing and hygiene seriously, and not squandering our advantage," he said.
Dr Bloomfield also touched on flu vaccination, noting that 451,000 people over the age of 65 have been vaccinated - already exceeding the total number vaccinated during the whole campaign last year within that demographic.
More Māori in the over-65 age bracket have been vaccinated over the past five weeks than in the entire year of vaccination in 2019.
As of Monday, 1.4 million doses of the flu vaccine have been distributed to providers. As of April 30, 700,000 doses have been recorded on the national immunisation register as administered.
"By vaccinating as many New Zealanders as possible, in particular our older people and vulnerable New Zealanders, it reduces the likelihood that they will get the flu and then suffer the sorts of illness that will put them in hospital," Dr Boomfield said. 
"The important role you have played over the last three months in supporting our collective efforts to keep the public informed, to ask the important questions and hard questions and to ensure we are being held to account for answering those."
