The president admits there may be "technical errors" , having previously suggested people could pray the disease away.
The accuracy of coronavirus tests used in Tanzania has been questioned by the country's president after a goat and a papaya both tested positive for the disease.
The president claimed he asked security forces to check the quality of the kits and that they randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a papaya, a goat and a sheep, but had assigned them human names and ages.
Mr Magufuli said the return of positive results on the goat and papaya indicated some people were testing positive despite not having the virus.
"There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation," he said, adding that the kits should be investigated.
However, unlike most other African countries, its government sometimes goes for days without offering updates - with officials having last done so on Wednesday,
Mr Magufuli also said he was sending a plane to collect a herbal cure being promoted by Madagascar's president.
Tens of millions of Africans who live their lives on the edge will soon face an even harder battle to survive
"They have got a medicine. We will send a flight there and the medicine will be brought in the country so that Tanzanians too can benefit."
COVID-19 infections and deaths reported across Africa have been relatively low compared with the Europe, the US and parts of Asia although the continent has extremely low levels of testing - with rates of only around 500 per million people.
