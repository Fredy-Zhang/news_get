However, many of the Chinese government’s missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information and officials hesitant to report bad news.

It’s a crowded field, but researchers say that only increases the odds that a few might overcome the many obstacles that remain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re not really in a competition against each other. We’re in a race against a pandemic virus, and we really need as many players in that race as possible,” Dr. Andrew Pollard, who is leading the University of Oxford’s vaccine study, told The Associated Press.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"e7e0b200-6ae0-11ea-873d-afa407193002\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The hard truth: There’s no way to predict which — if any — vaccine will work safely, or even to name a front-runner. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top expert, put it: “You need more shots on goal for a chance at getting a safe and effective vaccine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The first cautious tests of March, when small numbers of volunteers got injections to check for side effects, have turned into larger studies in China, the U.S. and Europe to look for hints that different vaccine candidates really protect.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='d07c712f8eba4613b4655a4d92647af8' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Next: Finding out for sure if any of the vaccines work in the real world by testing large groups of people in areas where the virus is circulating — a tricky prospect when study participants may be in places where the virus is fading or they are told to stay home — and finding a way to quickly distribute lots of doses of any successful candidates. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Policymakers are devising plans to try to overcome both obstacles in an attempt to compress the years it usually takes to develop a vaccine. Asked if a vaccine by January was possible, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, told Fox News Sunday “on paper, it’s possible.

That’s important because if one type fails, maybe another won’t. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Different types of vaccines work better in some virus families than others. But for coronaviruses, there’s no blueprint. Back in 2003 when scientists attempted vaccines against SARS, a cousin of the new virus, animal studies hinted at safety problems but then SARS disappeared and vaccine funding dried up. Vaccines against another COVID-19 cousin named MERS have only reached first-step safety testing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In 20/20 hindsight, we should have worked harder on coronavirus vaccines back then,” said Dr. Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. Now, “we’re obligated to try a variety of strategies if we want fast results.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>PROS AND CONS\u003c/p>\u003cp>China’s Sinovac and SinoPharm are testing “inactivated” vaccines, made by growing the new coronavirus and killing it. The companies have revealed little information about how the shots differ. But the technology is tried-and-true — polio shots and some types of flu vaccine are inactivated virus — although it’s hard to scale up to rapidly produce millions of doses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most other vaccines in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize a piece of the new coronavirus — mostly, the spiky protein that studs its outer surface. \u003c/p>\u003cp>One way: Use a harmless virus to carry the spike protein into the body. It’s easier to produce but determining which virus is the best “carrier” is a key question. China’s CanSino Biologics brewed its vaccine using a common cold-causing adenovirus, engineered so it won’t spread in the body. And in case people’s immune systems fight off the cold virus before the vaccine can do its job, Pollard’s Oxford team instead chose an adenovirus that normally infects chimpanzees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another way: Inject a piece of the coronavirus genetic code that instructs the body itself to produce spike protein that in turn primes the immune system to attack. It’s a new and unproven technology but one that promises even faster production. Vaccines made by NIH and Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, and that Pfizer-BioNtech collaboration use genetic code approaches.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still more methods are next in line: Vaccine made of spike protein nanoparticles, and even a nasal spray alternative to shots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>PROVING THEY WORK\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most vaccine studies so far are tracking safety and whether volunteers’ blood shows any immune reactions. Some have jumped to larger numbers quickly, but there’s still concern about being able to prove real-world protection. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If study participants are holed up at home or live in areas where the virus has quit spreading rapidly, then too few may get sick for scientists to tell if the vaccine or social distancing was what protected them. The Oxford study, for example, will track about 1,000 people, half given the real vaccine. But the team plans a later-stage study with another 5,000 volunteers for a final answer and knows it might have to move to other countries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When you’re chasing a pandemic, the place that looks like the right one to go to today will be the wrong place two weeks from now. And that makes it really difficult,” Pollard said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the U.S., some lawmakers have urged a different and controversial experiment: Recruit young, healthy volunteers who agree to be deliberately infected with the new coronavirus to prove if a vaccine protects them. But some healthy adults do die from COVID-19 — and until doctors better understand why, that so-called “challenge study” makes for a risky proposition with serious ethical questions, Yale’s Vermund noted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The World Health Organization last week called for countries to offer to be test sites for an international project that will speed the timeline by admitting on a rolling basis promising vaccine candidates for further study in locations where COVID-19 remains widespread at the time. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the U.S., the Trump administration is planning its own project dubbed Operation Warp Speed that will overlap studies of “different candidates that are made differently and act differently,” Birx said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If early evidence was strong enough and the virus is still widespread, the Food and Drug Administration might even consider emergency use of a vaccine before final test results were in, Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA office that oversees vaccines, recently told reporters.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se1:13641480-6ae0-11ea-b7d7-a104b73721bc\">\u003ciframe aria-describedby=\"China's COVID-19 cases have notably plateaued according to reports, leveling off the ascent since mid-February. \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-dDzn8\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dDzn8/6/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" title=\"Interactive line chart Flattening the coronavirus curve\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();\u003c/script>\n\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>SUPPLYING THE WORLD\u003c/p>\u003cp>Whenever the first useful vaccine is identified, there won’t be enough for everyone.

The U.S. government already has deals with Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson that together total nearly $1 billion and include scaling up production. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The critical thing at the beginning is just to make as much stuff as we can,” said Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is funding several COVID-19 vaccine attempts around the world.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if one works, expect rationing early on as policymakers determine who most needs the first doses — possibly health workers or the elderly — until there’s enough for the world, rich and poor countries alike.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I am concerned about what I call vaccine nationalism.

Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the figures were clearly encouraging, but the result represented a moment in time and it won’t be until later this week that officials will know if new cases are continuing to pop up in the community. He said the result was a cause for celebration and was symbolic of the efforts of the entire country. \u003c/p>\u003cp>New Zealand closed its borders and imposed a strict monthlong lockdown after the outbreak began. The lockdown rules were eased a little last week to help reopen the economy, but many restrictions remain in place. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many businesses — including most retail stores and sit-down restaurants — remain closed, most school children are learning from home, and people are required to maintain social distancing.

But the move has split public opinion amid fears that the sudden reopening of economic activities could spark a new wave of infection. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Nine of the country’s 13 states have either refused to open up yet or restricted the list of businesses that can operate. More than half a million Malaysians have also protested by signing online petitions to call for a more gradual approach to rolling back the restrictions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Muhyiddin said Friday it was time to heal the economy, which has lost billions of dollars, but businesses must follow strict health measures and mass gatherings will still be banned. That means places such as schools, cinemas and worship houses will stay shut, group sports are prohibited, and interstate travel remains banned. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Virus cases have dropped sharply in recent weeks but the number crept up with 227 infections reported over the weekend.

Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that New York will join with states from Massachusetts to Delaware to create a regional supply chain for masks, gowns, ventilators, testing supplies and other equipment vital to fighting the disease.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The states are joining together after months of dealing separately with what Cuomo said was a “totally inefficient and ineffective” purchasing process that pitted all 50 states against each other, as well as the federal government and other entities, driving up prices as supplies dried up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New York buys about $2 billion worth of medical equipment supplies per year, Cuomo said. The other states joining the consortium together spend about $5 billion per year. Working together, they’ll have stronger purchasing power and improve their clout with global suppliers, Cuomo said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It will make us more competitive in the international marketplace and I believe it will save taxpayers money,” Cuomo said. “I also believe it will actually help us get the equipment, because we have trouble still getting the equipment.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The other states in the consortium are Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. One goal, the states’ governors said, is to find suppliers within the region, instead of relying on swamped manufacturers in China and other faraway places.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WASHINGTON — Michigan’s governor says gun-carrying protesters who demonstrated inside her state’s Capitol “depicted some of the worst racism” and “awful parts” of U.S. history. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Democrat Gretchen Whitmer tells CNN that the protests featured “Confederate Flags, and nooses,” as well as swastikas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Members of the Michigan Liberty Militia protested the state’s stay-at-home orders this week, some with weapons and tactical gear and their faces partially covered. They went inside the Capitol, where being armed is allowed, then demanded access to the House floor, which is prohibited. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some went to the Senate gallery, where a senator said armed men shouted at her.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Michigan’s Republican-controlled Legislature has questioned Whitmer’s authority to extend stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the governor used an executive order to extend a state of emergency declaration and has directed most businesses statewide to remain closed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Mentioned as a possible running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Whitmer said Sunday, “This isn’t something we just negotiate ourselves out of and it’s a political matter.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is a public health crisis,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says China has been responsible for the spread of disease in the past and must be held accountable for the coronavirus pandemic that originated in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In comments likely to spark protests from Beijing and elsewhere, Pompeo said “China has a history of infecting the world.” He cited poor safety and security at epidemiological laboratories, including in the city of Wuhan where the virus was first reported.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He stressed that he had no reason to believe the virus was deliberately spread but he ramped up already harsh U.S. criticism of the Chinese for their response to the outbreak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,” Pompeo said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” program. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab. And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. But his remark may be seen as offensive in China given the history of U.S. discrimination against the Chinese and people of Chinese origin dating to the 19th century.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>ROME — On the eve of the start in Italy of partially eased restriction on citizens’ movements during COVID-19 lockdown, the nation received some encouraging news after weeks of grim daily tallies of caseload and deaths. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Health Ministry figures put the number of deaths in the 24-hour period ending Sunday evening at 174, the lowest day-to-day number since 168 on March 10, at the start of national lockdown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The number of new cases, 1,389, was also the lowest the nation has seen in two months. Italy’s number of known COVID-19 infections total is 210,717, although authorities say the number is likely higher as many infections in people with no or almost no symptoms are believed to have gone undetected. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy’s death toll stands at 28,884, but that number, too, could be much higher, since many elderly persons in recent weeks died in nursing homes but weren’t tested to see if they had coronavirus infection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>OLYMPIA, Wash. — More than 100 state parks, trails and boating sites across Washington state will re-open Tuesday as some coronavirus restrictions are eased, but many popular sites remain closed indefinitely, according to officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Parks that open will be limited to daytime use only and the number of parking spaces will be reduced at some urban parks to discourage crowding. Public lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Fish and Wildlife also will reopen Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>All ocean beach parks and parks along the Columbia River Gorge on the Washington-Oregon border will remain closed to reduce impacts on rural communities and prevent crowds, according to Washington State Parks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Discussions on when those sites could open are ongoing and involve park administrators, local community leaders and Oregon officials, state parks officials said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The parks have been closed more than a month and are being re-opened under the first phase of the Gov. Jay Inslee’s plan to ease rules imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. Beaches and campgrounds would re-open under the second phase of the plan, although large gatherings would still be banned.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has filed a statement of interest siding with a Virginia church suing the state’s governor over restrictions because of the coronavirus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The filing was made Sunday in support of the Lighthouse Fellowship Church.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The lawsuit alleges the church’s pastor, Kevin Wilson, was issued a criminal citation because he held a service with 16 people on April 5.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities allege the church violated the state’s ban on gatherings of more than 10 people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Justice Department’s filing, citing the lawsuit, says the church had maintained social distancing and had extensive sanitizing of common surfaces. The church said attendees had to stay 6 feet apart and use hand sanitizer before entering the building.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Justice Department says Virginia “cannot treat religious gatherings less favorably than other similar, secular gatherings.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A judge had denied the church’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on Friday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NEW YORK — A New York City police officer who was caught on video Saturday pointing a stun gun at a man and violently taking him to the ground over an alleged social distancing violation has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bystander video showed the plainclothes officer, who was not wearing a protective face mask, slapping 33-year-old Donni Wright in the face, punching him in the shoulder and dragging him to a sidewalk after leveling him in a crosswalk in Manhattan’s East Village.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There will unquestionably be a careful look at what happened there,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Police spokeswoman Sgt.
