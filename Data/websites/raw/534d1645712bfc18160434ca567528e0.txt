It shouldn't have happened," she said. </p></blockquote><p>"It's had an amazingly horrific impact. People have lost loved ones. They had to witness them in hospital having been completely burnt, being completely unrecognisable from their horrific burns, and people are having to somehow pick up the pieces," she said. </p><p>The tourists booked and paid for their trip to White island through Royal Caribbean.</p><p>"They were told in the brochure that all they needed to do if they were attending this tour was to wear enclosed shoes," she said. </p><p>The brochure promised visitors would, "Get close to the drama".</p><a name="responsiveimage"> </a><a name="wide12165774"> </a><div class="inline-content infographic full">
