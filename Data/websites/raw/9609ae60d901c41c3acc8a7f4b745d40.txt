		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Patterson’s hog farm near Kenyon typically sends animals to the Smithfield Foods processing plant in Sioux Falls. But he can’t now, after the plant shut down because of a COVID-19 outbreak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his usual buyer off the market, Patterson&#8217;s cooperative has shipped some pigs to an Illinois plant and found local butchers willing to take a small number of hogs. But thousands others are still at his farm, outgrowing barns and occupying space needed by younger pigs. “It really gets to the point where there’s only so much physical space we can have to house the hogs,” Patterson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The predicament is becoming increasingly common across Minnesota, where droves of hog farmers have nowhere left to sell their pigs as plants shutter during the pandemic. Along with Smithfield, a JBS pork plant in Worthington closed Monday after 26 workers tested positive for the coronavirus. Comfrey Farm&#8217;s Prime Pork plant in Windom was <a href="https://www.startribune.com/comfrey-farm-pork-plant-in-windom-closes-for-2-days-because-of-coronavirus/569865332/">temporarily shuttered</a> Tuesday after one employee tested positive. And Tyson Foods also idled a massive Iowa plant Wednesday.</span></p>

			The result: a national processing capacity that’s been diminished by more than 100,000 pigs per day, said David Preisler, CEO of the Minnesota Pork Board. The crunch is felt acutely in Minnesota, the country’s second-highest pork producing state, where farmers are taking a financial hit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet beyond the money, plant shutdowns are forcing some farmers to consider an unfortunate last resort to ease their backlog of hogs: putting them down. Preisler said farmers may have to kill and dispose of 200,000 pigs in the state that can’t reach the market over the next few weeks. “You reach a point where you have to make a decision on things,” Preisler said. “And that’s unfortunately where we’re at right now.”</span></p>
<h4><b>A backup builds</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About half of pigs raised in Minnesota are processed in Minnesota, and the other half go to packing plants in neighboring states — primarily Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska and Missouri. The average farm has about 2,400 hogs, Preisler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Preisler said the industry has planned for disease outbreaks in animals, the coronavirus pandemic case is different: it’s affecting only humans and causing a severe disruption to processing facilities. For several weeks, farmers have been slowing down pig growth to conserve space. Patterson said he’s been feeding hogs a high fiber diet that has less calories, which he called “salad for pigs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the diet only works for so long. Patterson is part of a cooperative of 12 farmers that raises piglets in jointly-owned nursery facilities. Those young pigs are getting too big for the nursery, while the pigs still on Patterson’s farm are gaining weight and taking up more and more existing space. Eventually, he said, there is no way to ethically house all the pigs in such tight quarters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing plants take older and heavier hogs, but at a discount since machinery is not designed for them, and they don’t match what people typically buy. (“Big hams don’t sell,” Patterson said.) So even if there was space to keep pigs longer, it might not be financially worth it for some farmers to cover the cost of food and transportation to the plant once they reopen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson’s pigs aren’t currently facing euthanasia, thanks to a few lucky breaks, he said. Smithfield was able to take a few shipments of hogs from the cooperative to a processing plant in Illinois — about 25 percent of what the cooperative would normally send off — and Patterson said that may be an occasional option. He has also been able to find local butchers to process about 40 hogs per week for a month and a half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically those shops are full with other orders already, as are large nearby processing plants, Patterson said. “Me getting 10 percent of my hogs into local butcher shops is very fortunate and I would say pretty rare,” he said.</span></p>
<h4><b>Farmers say they have no choice</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other farmers won’t be so lucky. Besides slowing growth or finding local butchers, hog farmers can give some pigs away to be rendered and made into pet food. The last option is to start putting them down without any use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pork farmers aren’t the first industry in agriculture to face brutal choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. As demand for eggs has dropped farmers are euthanizing chickens, </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/egg-demand-shifted-and-61-000-minnesota-chickens-were-euthanized/569817312/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Star Tribune reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And farmers throwing away milk and </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-lettuce/california-farmer-plows-under-lettuce-after-coronavirus-shutters-restaurant-market-idUSKCN21Y02M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plowing under crops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the country have garnered national headlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

			Preisler said the Pork Board is working to figure out how to help farmers humanely kill animals and properly dispose of them. Pigs are slaughtered at processing facilities, so farmers don’t have experience with wide-scale “depopulation,” as Preisler put it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for disposal, one common technique is composting. Patterson said he already composts pigs that die on his farm during normal operations, though expanding it to handle necessary volume would be difficult and labor-intensive, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden need for composting help has given state government another new and strange role during the pandemic: mulch wranglers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Crusan, a spokesman for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, said composting allows farmers to spread remains as fertilizer back onto land. But it needs massive quantities of materials like wood chips, corn stalks, sawdust or straw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has been trying to find large quantities of the stuff to help farmers. The state can’t buy it, since COVID-19 is not known to affect livestock, but the Animal Health board can play the role of middleman to connect farmers to materials. A state survey already <a href="https://www.bah.state.mn.us/carcass-disposal/#emergency-carcass-disposal-resources-during-covid-19">has dozens of responses</a> from companies with wood chips, “raw tree material,” sawdust, leaf compost and more to offer. It’s also legal to incinerate, bury pigs in certain soils or send pigs to landfills, though Preisler said Minnesota doesn&#8217;t have incinerators that could handle large numbers of hogs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an absolute tragedy this has to happen,” Crusan said. “We don’t want to get rid of these animals in this way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preisler said it’s possible farmers could avoid putting down some pigs if either JBS or Smithfield reopen soon. But even if they did, backed up demand and other hurdles mean a “large number” of animals will still be killed without being eaten, Preisler said.</span></p>

		<p>Depopulating. What a sanitary word. If this doesn’t make you want to be a vegetarian I don’t know what will.  How horrible. Please follow up and let us know what means they choose to “depopulate”. Makes me furious. All these farmers just put them in a truck and off they go. I’m kinda of glad they now have to know the pain and suffering these pigs go through. In case you didn’t know, they all stand there and watch each other get slaughtered. Pigs are very intelligent animals. Unlike human beings.</p>

		<p>If I had room in my freezer I’d take one off their hands.  Mmmm bacon&#8230; one of the healthiest foods you can eat.   </p>
<p>This is just life. If you want food you need to kill animals.   Humans are omnivores meaning we eat both meats and plants.</p>

		<p>Thank you for your humane comments, Betsy. Our family has been vegetarian for years for reasons just like this. We find suffering and cruelty towards our fellow creatures, like pigs, to be intolerable to stomach &#8211; literally. If only everyone thought like you, instead of trying to justify themselves for what is truly murder.</p>

		<p>I agree with Betsy Larey.  People need to stop eating so much meat.  It&#8217;s disgusting.  Do you know what all that meat does to your insides.  Become a vegetarian people.  It&#8217;s time!  It&#8217;s healthier and kinder.</p>

		<p>Yes it’s a cruel world I have been doing swine for 42 years it’s the same thing that happened when the so called swine flue came about we as producer keep our swine as healthy and disease free as possible no one wants to destroy these beautiful animals this came about so fast there’s a lot of farms closed and probably won’t reopen this is there life as producers just pray the packers reopened soon so there won’t be a waste of meat ever body has a opinion on this problem if you don’t like it don’t read about it there’s a lot of broken people and 💕</p>

		<p>Consider giving hogs to poor communities.  Second Harvest and other organizations may be able to coordinate efforts.  Plenty of hunters etc can butcher them.  Ship them to Cuba  and other neighboring developing countries.Ill  I&#8217;ll contribute to shipping costs.</p>

		<p>Organizations like Second Harvest and food shelves can only accept meat that has been processed in state and federally licensed processing plants or butchers. The same goes for exporting meat to other countries</p>

		<p>Too bad the processing plant operators didn&#8217;t take the virus seriously (I wonder why?) and create a safe work environment for their workers. They might have saved themselves a ton of money, but no. So they are where they are.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately it sounds like the relatively blameless hog farmers are the ones paying the bigger price, while the large-scale pork plants have likely applied for the &#8220;small business&#8221; lifeline&#8230;</p>

		<p>This is the price that is paid for the ridiculous oversupply of pork (and meat in general) that we have in this country. Unfortunately the animals are the ones who must pay it. And those underpaid scut workers who are ordered to perform it. </p>
<p>Of course those of the &#8220;conservative&#8221; mindset are also the ones most callous to the situation. (&#8220;This is just life&#8221;: how wonderful for the supposedly civilized creature who wound up at the top of the food chain&#8230;)</p>
<p>And there is no good way to &#8220;euthanize&#8221; the hogs, either.  The big Ag interests have seen to that.</p>

		<p>This isn’t just a disaster for the farmers. In a couple of months, what are we going to eat?  The same problem is spreading the the poultry and beef Industries. We need to have a different Covid-19 strategy than just shutting everything down.</p>

Minnesota, droves of hog farmers have nowhere left to sell their pigs as plants shutter, forcing some farmers to consider an unfortunate last resort to ease their backlog of hogs: putting them down.","articleSection":"Health","articleBody":"Mike Patterson\u2019s hog farm near Kenyon typically sends animals to the Smithfield Foods processing plant in Sioux Falls. But he can\u2019t now, after the plant shut down because of a COVID-19 outbreak.\r\n\r\nWith his usual buyer off the market, Patterson's cooperative has shipped some pigs to an Illinois plant and found local butchers willing to take a small number of hogs. But thousands others are still at his farm, outgrowing barns and occupying space needed by younger pigs. \u201cIt really gets to the point where there\u2019s only so much physical space we can have to house the hogs,\u201d Patterson said.\r\n\r\nThe predicament is becoming increasingly common across Minnesota, where droves of hog farmers have nowhere left to sell their pigs as plants shutter during the pandemic. Along with Smithfield, a JBS pork plant in Worthington closed Monday after 26 workers tested positive for the coronavirus. Comfrey Farm's Prime Pork plant in Windom was temporarily shuttered Tuesday after one employee tested positive. And Tyson Foods also idled a massive Iowa plant Wednesday.\r\n\r\n[cms_ad:x100]The result: a national processing capacity that\u2019s been diminished by more than 100,000 pigs per day, said David Preisler, CEO of the Minnesota Pork Board. The crunch is felt acutely in Minnesota, the country\u2019s second-highest pork producing state, where farmers are taking a financial hit.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYet beyond the money, plant shutdowns are forcing some farmers to consider an unfortunate last resort to ease their backlog of hogs: putting them down. Preisler said farmers may have to kill and dispose of 200,000 pigs in the state that can\u2019t reach the market over the next few weeks. \u201cYou reach a point where you have to make a decision on things,\u201d Preisler said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unfortunately where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d\r\nA backup builds\r\nAbout half of pigs raised in Minnesota are processed in Minnesota, and the other half go to packing plants in neighboring states \u2014 primarily Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska and Missouri. The average farm has about 2,400 hogs, Preisler said.\r\n\r\nWhile Preisler said the industry has planned for disease outbreaks in animals, the coronavirus pandemic case is different: it\u2019s affecting only humans and causing a severe disruption to processing facilities. For several weeks, farmers have been slowing down pig growth to conserve space. Patterson said he\u2019s been feeding hogs a high fiber diet that has less calories, which he called \u201csalad for pigs.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the diet only works for so long. Patterson is part of a cooperative of 12 farmers that raises piglets in jointly-owned nursery facilities. Those young pigs are getting too big for the nursery, while the pigs still on Patterson\u2019s farm are gaining weight and taking up more and more existing space. Eventually, he said, there is no way to ethically house all the pigs in such tight quarters.\r\n\r\nProcessing plants take older and heavier hogs, but at a discount since machinery is not designed for them, and they don\u2019t match what people typically buy. (\u201cBig hams don\u2019t sell,\u201d Patterson said.) So even if there was space to keep pigs longer, it might not be financially worth it for some farmers to cover the cost of food and transportation to the plant once they reopen.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPatterson\u2019s pigs aren\u2019t currently facing euthanasia, thanks to a few lucky breaks, he said. Smithfield was able to take a few shipments of hogs from the cooperative to a processing plant in Illinois \u2014 about 25 percent of what the cooperative would normally send off \u2014 and Patterson said that may be an occasional option. He has also been able to find local butchers to process about 40 hogs per week for a month and a half.\r\n\r\nTypically those shops are full with other orders already, as are large nearby processing plants, Patterson said. \u201cMe getting 10 percent of my hogs into local butcher shops is very fortunate and I would say pretty rare,\u201d he said.\r\nFarmers say they have no choice\r\nOther farmers won\u2019t be so lucky. Besides slowing growth or finding local butchers, hog farmers can give some pigs away to be rendered and made into pet food. The last option is to start putting them down without any use.\r\n\r\nPork farmers aren\u2019t the first industry in agriculture to face brutal choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. As demand for eggs has dropped farmers are euthanizing chickens, the Star Tribune reported. And farmers throwing away milk and plowing under crops around the country have garnered national headlines.\r\n\r\n[cms_ad:x101]Preisler said the Pork Board is working to figure out how to help farmers humanely kill animals and properly dispose of them. Pigs are slaughtered at processing facilities, so farmers don\u2019t have experience with wide-scale \u201cdepopulation,\u201d as Preisler put it.\r\n\r\nAs for disposal, one common technique is composting. Patterson said he already composts pigs that die on his farm during normal operations, though expanding it to handle necessary volume would be difficult and labor-intensive, he said.\r\n\r\nThe sudden need for composting help has given state government another new and strange role during the pandemic: mulch wranglers.\r\n\r\nMichael Crusan, a spokesman for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, said composting allows farmers to spread remains as fertilizer back onto land. But it needs massive quantities of materials like wood chips, corn stalks, sawdust or straw.\r\n\r\nThe state has been trying to find large quantities of the stuff to help farmers. The state can\u2019t buy it, since COVID-19 is not known to affect livestock, but the Animal Health board can play the role of middleman to connect farmers to materials. A state survey already has dozens of responses from companies with wood chips, \u201craw tree material,\u201d sawdust, leaf compost and more to offer. It\u2019s also legal to incinerate, bury pigs in certain soils or send pigs to landfills, though Preisler said Minnesota doesn't have incinerators that could handle large numbers of hogs.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute tragedy this has to happen,\u201d Crusan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get rid of these animals in this way.\u201d\r\n\r\nPreisler said it\u2019s possible farmers could avoid putting down some pigs if either JBS or Smithfield reopen soon. But even if they did, backed up demand and other hurdles mean a \u201clarge number\u201d of animals will still be killed without being eaten, Preisler said.","keywords":"coronavirus, COVID-19, ","name":"\u2018An absolute tragedy\u2019: COVID-19-related plant shutdowns\u00a0could force hog farmers to kill and dispose o ...","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/www.minnpost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/HogFace640.jpg","wordCount":"1064","timeRequired":"283","mainEntity":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/www.minnpost.com\/greater-minnesota\/2020\/04\/an-absolute-tragedy-covid-19-related-plant-shutdowns-could-force-hog-farmers-to-put-down-200000-pigs\/"},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Walker Orenstein","description":"Walker Orenstein covers the environment and workforce issues for MinnPost.
