Quebec&#x27;s nursing homes unfolded</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>Some 80 per cent of the deaths in Quebec are linked to the seniors&#x27; homes, which have been hit particularly hard in the Montreal area.</p>  <p>CBC News spoke with two employees in this position, but is withholding their identities because they fear professional repercussions for going public.</p>  <p>&quot;Ruth&quot; and &quot;Alexis&quot; are Montreal-area health professionals that give therapy for people with physical impairments. Neither are medically trained.</p>  <h2>No guarantee of adequate PPE</h2>  <p>Both women said they received a two-hour training session before they were supposed to be dispatched to a CHSLD. That&#x27;s woefully inadequate, they said: staff were going into a totally new environment — many, if not the majority, have not worked in geriatric care.</p>  <p>They were told they&#x27;d be working as assistants to patient attendants, known in Quebec as PABs.</p>  <p>In addition, they were told they&#x27;d only be given cloth masks — and in some cases, surgical gowns — despite being asked to work inside homes with COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>  <p>&quot;Everyone was so shocked,&quot; Alexis said.</p>  <p>&quot;The hands flew up. Do we take the gown off when we&#x27;re going from a COVID-19 patient to a non-COVID-19 patient? But the [instructor] was like, as long as you&#x27;re not going too near them, you shouldn&#x27;t have to change your gown.&quot;</p>  <p>In a statement, the West-Central Montreal regional health authority (known by its French-language acronym, CIUSSS), defended its training, saying it&#x27;s both theoretical and practical. It said that all &quot;necessary&quot; PPE will be made available for staff.</p>  <p>If there was adequate protective equipment, Alexis said she would feel comfortable in the new role — but she left the training feeling unprotected and unready to go into a long-term care home.</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-nursing-homes-understaffed-1.5531997" class="similarLink" data-contentid=""><span class="similarLinkText">Why are Quebec&#x27;s nursing homes so understaffed, and what&#x27;s being done about it?</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>Ruth and Alexis both said they were shown how to put on a mask during the training, but weren&#x27;t given masks to practise.</p>  <p>Ruth said the masks they were shown were not the same type of masks that were available at the long-term care facility where she is now working.</p>  <p>In its statement, the West-Central Montreal regional health authority said that the training to put on a mask is universal to all types of face masks.</p>  <h2>Risk of getting fired</h2>  <p>Ruth and Alexis said employees were not given a say in their assignment — and that many are being sent to the worst-hit CHSLDs in Quebec. Others are being forced to travel far from their homes and work overnight shifts.</p>  <p>An email sent to some employees of the West-Central Montreal regional health authority said &quot;a list of employees designated for deployment has been created … this is a majority of staff.&quot;</p>  <p>&quot;[The instructor] even said in the training, if you refuse to go, you&#x27;ll be fired. She said it very nonchalantly,&quot; said Alexis.</p>  <p>Ruth was also told that if she refused to work, her contract could be terminated.  </p>  <p>&quot;It didn&#x27;t even seem like an option. It is what it is. There was no discussion,&quot; she said.</p>  <h2>Redeployment &#x27;not optional&#x27;</h2>  <p>In its statement, the West-Central Montreal regional health authority said &quot;we are aware that redeployment of staff can cause stress and anxiety. We are doing our best to support our colleagues working in Long Term Care sites.&quot;</p>  <p>It goes on to say that the redeployment is not optional, and that it was decided by a ministerial decree due to the present health crisis.</p></span></div></div><div class="contentFeedback"><div class="bottomSeparator"><a href="https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/vision/governance/journalistic-standards-and-practices" class="journalistLink">CBC&#x27;s Journalistic Standards and Practices</a><span class="separator">|</span><a href="/news/about-cbc-news-1.1294364" class="trustProjectLink">About CBC <!-- -->News</a></div><button class="reportIssue feedbackButton" id="">Report Typo or Error</button></div><div class="relatedlinks sclt-relatedlinks"><h2 class="headingText">Related Stories</h2><ul class="relatedList"><div class="relatedStory"><li class="relatedListItem"><a class="relatedLink" href="/news/canada/montreal/timeline-quebec-nursing-homes-covid-crisis-1.5544538"> <!-- -->How the COVID-19 crisis in Quebec&#x27;s nursing homes unfolded</a></li><li class="relatedListItem"><a class="relatedLink" href="/news/canada/montreal/quebec-nursing-homes-understaffed-1.5531997"> <!-- -->Why are Quebec&#x27;s nursing homes so understaffed, and what&#x27;s being done about it?</a></li><li class="relatedListItem"><a class="relatedLink" href="/news/canada/montreal/covid-19-april-25-1.5545063"> <!-- -->COVID-19 in Quebec: Arruda recommends wearing masks when distancing not possible</a></li><li class="relatedListItem"><a class="relatedLink" href="/news/canada/montreal/ethical-dilemma-as-quebec-eases-covid-19-lockdown-1.5540549"> <!-- -->Why ending Quebec&#x27;s COVID-19 lockdown could mean freedom for some, but not all</a></li></div></ul></div><div class="newsletterWidget newsletterWidget-NEW014"><div class="newsletterWidgetTextWrapper"><h2><img src="/a/static/media/cbcnewsletter.svg" class="newsletterWidgetLogo" alt="CBC Newsletters" height="auto" width="260"/></h2><div class="newsletterWidgetSloganDesc"><p class="newsletterWidgetSlogan ">Add some “good” to your morning and evening.</p><p class="newsletterWidgetDesc ">A variety of newsletters you&#x27;ll love, delivered straight to you.</p></div></div><a href="https://subscriptions.cbc.ca/listmanagement?cmp=feed_generic_newsletter-subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="newsletterWidgetLink">Sign up now</a></div></div><div class="detailSideRail"><div class="stickyContainer stickyRailAd"></div><div class="stickyContainer"><div class="detailDiscovery"><div class="lazy-load"></div></div></div></div><div class="lazy-load"></div><div class="detailDiscovery"><div class="lazy-load"></div><div class="commentsWrapper"><div class="detailMainCol"><div class="comments cbc-vf" id="comments-15545292"><div name="comments-15545292"><h2 class="headingText"><span><span class="vf-counter vf-widget" data-widget="counter" data-path="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/physios-social-workers-redeployed-montreal-1.5545292"></span><span> Comments</span></span></h2><p class="commentIntro">To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada&#x27;s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).
