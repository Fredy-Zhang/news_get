morgue with room for 150 bodies.</p><p>The volunteer-run mortuary, with its white tents, industrial refrigerators and neat stacks of coffins, is evidence of the toll the virus is taking on Britain&rsquo;s Muslim and ethnic-minority communities.<br>The two most diverse regions of the UK &mdash; London and the Midlands area centred in Birmingham &mdash; have seen the largest number of deaths in the outbreak.</p><p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Students return to class in Shanghai and Beijing</b></p><p>Tens of thousands of students returned to school in Shanghai and Beijing Monday
